# Truss Solver
 It is a FEM solver that calculates displacements, stresses and reactions of a plane truss system made of isotropic material subjected to nodal forces.
 
To define the system you simply have to modify the six .txt files as shown in the first two rows of each document with material and sections property, nodes coordinates, connectivity table, restraints and at the end nodal forces applied (don't modify file names).

Then you have to run TrussSolver.m matlab script to check the setting and collect the results (as .txt output and graphically).
